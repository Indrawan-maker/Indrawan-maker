<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey there, I’m Muhammad Indrawan Ismail, a 3rd-semester Information Systems student at Sultan Aji Muhammad Idris University Samarinda. I love gaming, especially Mobile Legends and Genshin Impact. But right now, my phone is already six years old and I haven’t replaced it yet, and my Ryzen 5 laptop isn’t strong enough to run the games I usually play.

Lately, I’ve been spending most of my time coding. Honestly, I didn’t really know what to do during my holidays, so I just ended up coding. For me, coding feels like a new game  it’s challenging and makes me curious to keep learning. I like do the hard things until the easy one felt boring.

I can’t dance (definitely not DJ either), and I’m not that good at speaking, but I’m pretty good with crayons. My main focus right now is to level up my programming skills as much as possible, but I know it’s a gradual process, and I’m improving little by little </p>
