<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey there, I’m Muhammad Indrawan Ismail, a 3rd-semester Information Systems student at Sultan Aji Muhammad Idris University Samarinda. I love gaming, especially Mobile Legends and Genshin Impact. But right now, my phone is already six years old and I haven’t replaced it yet, and my Ryzen 5 laptop isn’t strong enough to run the games I usually play.

I’ve been spending most of my time coding. Honestly, I didn’t really know what to do during my holidays, so I just ended up coding. For me, coding feels like a new game  it’s challenging and makes me curious to keep learning. I like do the hard things until the easy one felt boring.

I can’t dance (definitely not DJ either), and I’m not that good at speaking, but I’m pretty good with crayons.
